This project aimed to develop a machine learning model for BMI estimation based on facial features.
Transfer learning with VGG16 and data augmentation techniques were utilized to improve the model's performance.
The evaluation metrics used were mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). 
Although the achieved RMSE was still relatively high, further improvements can be made by addressing dataset imbalances, overfitting, model complexity, and exploring additional features or data sources.
Future enhancements could include incorporating body measurements or lifestyle factors, exploring advanced computer vision techniques, utilizing advanced data augmentation methods, and conducting extensive hyperparameter tuning.
These enhancements will contribute to higher accuracy and real-world applicability in BMI estimation from facial images.
