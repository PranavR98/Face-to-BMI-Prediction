● This project aims to estimate Body Mass Index (BMI) using facial images and
machine learning techniques.
● By leveraging pretrained models like VGG-16 and transfer learning, the
project extracts features from facial images to accurately calculate BMI.
● The goal is to create a web API that can calculate BMI from uploaded pictures
or in real-time using a webcam.
